    "text":"The pizza was okay. Not the best I've had. I prefer Biaggio's on Flamingo \/ Fort Apache. The chef there can make a MUCH better NY style pizza.

Biaggio's is a much better pick if youre going for italian - family owned, home made recipes, people that actually CARE if you like their food. You dont get that at a pizzeria in a casino. I dont care what you say...",
